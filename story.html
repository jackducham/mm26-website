The year is 2674, humanity has reached for the stars, built cities on Mars, the Moon, Venus, and built giant robots on Earth to defend their homes. After a falling out of the various districts of the North American Treaty Coalition (NATC) have fragmented into city-states at engaged in a cold war arms race. The first nuclear powered Mech was created by the Kentucky Machinists Guild (KMG) and deployed in 2675 in an attempt to claim regions of Southern Illinois for KMG, and after a long grueling battle with the Midwestern Mechanized Defense Force (MMDF) it was critically struck, destroying it and causing it to overload and eradicate a significant portion of Southern Illinois, Indiana, parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Additionally Neo-Chicago seceded from the MMDF to become their own city state as a neutral party for trade. In the time that followed, the various factions began to fight amongst another over the now uninhabitable land of the Great Midwestern Wasteland. The years passed and the Wasteland Wars ended leaving the factions with scraps of Mech technology to create their own Mechs and improve their designs. The former neutral party of Neo Chicago has become the heart of every skirmish as the factions attempt to take the city that holds a positional advantage over the entirety of the Midwest.</p>
